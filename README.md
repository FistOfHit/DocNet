# DocNet

Analysis on a network-model of a group of doctors (nodes) and their social/professional interactions (edges) over a period of time in 4 cities in the US. We attempt to use a varitety of methods from network theory to come to conclusions about how this group performed and behaved and run some very interesting simulations.
